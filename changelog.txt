version-0.05.05-alpha

Updated call me alias command to help mitigate errors that occur when the user only says "call"
Removed a bunch of commands from bot_commands.py, we feel these commands are unnecessary, if you want them, download an old update (version-0.05.04) and transfer them into commands.py

Trimmed out the fat, removed fapthings as it wasn't needed anymore.

version-0.04.52-alpha

Updated 'restart
'restart command restarts the bot by disconnecting from all the rooms, the bot then launches restart.bat.
restart.bat force closes any python script launched by that user, be careful if running this as administrator
as it will also force close any python script by all users if the prompt is running as admin or root.
(You should never run this python script as root or administrator)

Added Config Option "prefix"
If you do not want to re-do your configuration, please edit config.py and include the following:

# Command Prefix
prefix = "'"

prefix is how your bot knows what a command is, such as 'restart, or ~restart or whatever you make the prefix to be.

Did some code-cleanup on bot.py, you may not notice it on your end since bot.py shouldn't be edited by you as the end 
user, but on the development side, it helps us ensure that the code is clean and easier for us to make changes to various 
functions and statements.

Updated Commands:
'ver
'v

||| Added Commands |||
remove my access
	Tells the bot to remove the access for the current user. If the user is the bot owner 
	this command will be ignored. Anyone else can be removed by them using this command.
	This will not remove a user from blacklist.

'leave & 'leave roomname
	This tells the bot to exit the room specified. If no room is specified the bot will leave 
	the current room it is in. This will not remove the room from the room list.

||| Updated Commands |||
'ver, 'v and 'version
	This command now shows the current version information for the bot as noted in the bot's
	version information file. Also displays the original source (Sorch) for Botteh 1.2, and 
	the bot owner and the maintainer of the bot's source code repository (Me)

background_color
update_cmds

name_color
	Requires you to use the hexadecimal version of the color, you can go to http://www.colorpicker.com/ 
	to determine what your hex will be. The # should not be included. This controls the color that is shown
	on chatango for the username.

font_color
	Requires you to use the hexadecimal version of the color, you can go to http://www.colorpicker.com/ 
	to determine what your hex will be. The # should not be included. This controls the color that is shown
	on chatango for the message text.

background_color
	Requires you to use the hexadecimal version of the color, you can go to http://www.colorpicker.com/ 
	to determine what your hex will be. The # should not be included. This controls the color that is shown
	on chatango for the background of the bot. Eventually you may be able to use an image url in this field. (Future thoughts.)

update_cmds
	A yes or no question, if you choose yes, we will download any updates we make to commands.py from the
	update site, if you choose no we will ignore commands.py. Choose yes if you don't make your own commands, 
	choose no if you make your own. Default is yes.
